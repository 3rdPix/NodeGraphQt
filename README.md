### Blueprint Node Graph

This repository contains a *work in progress* node graph that I'm working on in my spare time, as
I wanted to learn how to write a node graph in python using [PySide](http://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside/).

A node graph widget that can be implemented and repurposed into applications
that supports PySide.
